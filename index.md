I am a sixth year PhD candidate in Economics at Northwestern University, with research interests in macroeconomics, behavioral economics, and time series econometrics. 

<b> I will be on the 2024-2025 academic job market. </b> 

I am fortunate to be an [NBER Dissertation Fellow in Behavioral Macroeconomics](https://www.nber.org/career-resources/postdoctoral-and-graduate-fellows-academic-year-2023-24) and a Visiting Scholar at the [Chicago Fed](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/index) for the 2024-2025 academic year. 

I have worked on a number of open-source software projects broadly related to structural macroeconomic modeling, including [`sequence-jacobian`](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian), [`DSGE.jl`](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl), [`StateSpaceRoutines.jl`](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/StateSpaceRoutines.jl), and [`SMC.jl`](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/SMC.jl).
