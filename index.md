I am a second year PhD student in Economics at Northwestern University, pursuing research in the intersection of macroeconomics and finance, with a particular interests in household and public finance, monetary policy, and banking.

I am currently a research assistant to [Matt Rognlie](https://sites.northwestern.edu/rognlie/), where I am helping to build software that implements the [Sequence Space Jacobian](https://shade-econ.github.io/sequence-jacobian/sequence_jacobian_paper.pdf) to help solve and estimate a wide class of heterogeneous agent general equilibrium models. The Github repository for ongoing work on this software is linked [here](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian/tree/develop).

I was formerly a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, working with [Marco Del Negro](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/economists/delnegro) and the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) team within the Macroeconomic and Monetary Studies Group. As part of the group, I lead the development of [DSGE.jl](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl), an open source [Julia](https://julialang.org) package for implementing, estimating, and forecasting with DSGE models.
