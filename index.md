I am a first year PhD student in Economics at Northwestern University, pursuing research in the intersection of household, consumer, and public finance.

I was formerly a research analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, working with [Marco Del Negro](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/economists/delnegro) and the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) team within the Macroeconomic and Monetary Studies Group. As part of the group, I lead the development of [DSGE.jl](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl), an open source [Julia](https://julialang.org) package for implementing, estimating, and forecasting with DSGE models.

Other topics that broadly interest me include land use, development, and political economy.
