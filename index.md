I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Rutgers University](https://economics.rutgers.edu/), with research interests in heterogeneous-agent macroeconomics and bounded rationality. 

I received my PhD in Economics from Northwestern University in 2025. I have also contributed to a few open-source projects related to structural macroeconomic modeling
