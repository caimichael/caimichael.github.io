**Macro Inertia and the Variable Lags of Policy Transmission**  

This paper quantifies the sources of macroeconomic inertia that policymakers can and cannot influence and analyzes how changes in systematic policy conduct can reduce inertial transmission ("lags"). To isolate policy-invariant inertia due to preferences and technologies, I introduce an approach to identifying parameters in dynamic structural models, which directly uses survey data on expectations in place of traditional assumptions on expectations. Applied to standard consumption-savings models, I find only two simple features are needed to match the dynamic response of consumption to shocks: 1) a high current MPC and 2) a low EIS. There is no need for classic sources of preference inertia, such as habits. In an estimated HANK model with learning disciplined by these estimates and expectations data, inertia emerges endogenously when a measure of belief feedback strength is high but is absent otherwise. This measure is large precisely when the current MPC is high and EIS is low. Stabilizing monetary and fiscal policy can reduce feedback, shortening transmission lags. Monetary-fiscal interactions produce a novel government debt stabilization motive to reduce lags: shortening the timeline for debt repayment diminishes belief feedback from past, stale expectations into future realized demand.

**Optimal Long-Run Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents**  
(with Adrien Auclert, Matt Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub)  

We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.
