**HANK with Actual Expectations Solves the Persistence Puzzle**  

Inertial responses of aggregate variables to unexpected shocks is a key business cycle fact.
Textbook macroeconomic models lack mechanisms that enhance the persistence of shocks and
thus struggle to rationalize this fact without additional features. I show that perpetual youth
and standard incomplete markets models — the core of modern HANK models — can match
this fact with one simple change: replace model expectations with expectations data.
Many existing theories of expectation formation cannot match patterns of bias in expectations data but
a simple Bayesian learning model can explain them. Building on this, I characterize a novel
mechanism that produces endogenous persistence in HANK models with learning. Inertia
results from delayed amplification of an initial shock due to the gradual unanchoring of
expectations. I consider two key dimensions of systematic policy 1) responsiveness to fluctuations,
e.g. the slope of the Taylor rule, and 2) time length of government debt rollover and show that the length of lags vary with these choices.

**Optimal Long-Run Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents**  
(with Adrien Auclert, Matt Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub)  

We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.
