**HANK with Actual Expectations**  

Replacing traditional assumptions on expectation formation with expectations data, I show
that canonical heterogeneous agent models without further modification can match a core business cycle fact: the inertial response of aggregate consumption to macroeconomic shocks.
Systematic patterns of expectational errors in the data do not neatly conform to many existing
theories of expectation formation, both full-information rational expectations (FIRE) and those
uniformly predicting under- or over-reaction relative to FIRE. Expectations formed with a
simple model of Bayesian learning can match these patterns. I analyze the determinants of
aggregate consumption inertia in a stylized heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model with learning
and document a novel mechanism that inertia changes with systematic policy conduct.
In other words, lags are variable. In this model, inertia emerges when certain “belief feedback”
measures, functions of household elasticities and policy rule responsiveness, are large.
Monetary-fiscal interactions produce a new government debt stabilization channel for
reducing lags: shortening the debt repayment timeline diminishes “belief feedback” from inertial
past expectations into future realized demand.

**Optimal Long-Run Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents**  
(with Adrien Auclert, Matt Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub)  

We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.
