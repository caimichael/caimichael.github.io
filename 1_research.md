**HANK with Actual Expectations Solves the Persistence Puzzle**  

The inertial response of aggregate variables to sudden shocks is a fact that many
macroeconomic models struggle to explain. While several theories of bounded rationality have been
proposed to justify this inertia, no consensus has emerged among them. I show canonical
heterogeneous agent models — Blanchard (1985) perpetual youth and Bewley (1986)
incomplete markets — can match this fact by directly using expectations data instead of model-based
expectations within a semi-structural estimation framework. To analyze the determinants and
policy implications of macroeconomic inertia, I then adopt a model of boundedly-rational Bayesian
learning, which can explain patterns of forecast errors in expectations data that prior theories
struggle to account for. Incorporating this into a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian (HANK)
environment, I provide a theory for how inertia arises endogenously. Inertia occurs due to
delayed amplification of an initial shock and persists due to self-reinforcing expectations that
gradually unanchor. I consider two dimensions of government policy 1) responsiveness to
fluctuations, e.g. the slope of the Taylor rule, and 2) speed of government debt repayment and
show how systematic changes along these dimensions can reduce the degree of inertia.

**Optimal Long-Run Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents**  
(with Adrien Auclert, Matt Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub)  

We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.
