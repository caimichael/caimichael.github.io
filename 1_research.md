**[Explaining the Macroeconomic Inertia Puzzle](/files/MichaelCai_JMP_Inertia.pdf)**  

Many macroeconomic models struggle to explain the sluggish response of aggregate variables
to sudden shocks and changes in policy. While numerous theories of adjustment frictions
and bounded rationality have been proposed to explain this macroeconomic inertia, no consensus
has emerged among them. I show that canonical heterogeneous-agent models—Blanchard
(1985) perpetual youth and Bewley (1986) incomplete markets—are consistent with aggregate
consumption inertia if agents’ average expectations of income and interest rates align with
survey expectations of these variables. To determine the causes and analyze the policy implications
of inertia, I adopt a model of frictional Bayesian learning which can explain patterns of
forecast errors in expectations data that existing theories struggle to account for. Incorporating
this form of learning into a standard heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian environment,
I provide a theory for how inertia arises endogenously. Inertia results when the equilibrium
amplification of an initial shock exceeds expectations, causing them to slowly unanchor. This
theory yields a novel drawback for inertial monetary policy rules and delayed financing of
fiscal deficits. Policy regimes that act more gradually result in longer transmission lags.

We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.
