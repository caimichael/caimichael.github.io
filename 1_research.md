    Benchmark macroeconomic models require additional frictions to explain the sluggish response of aggregate variables to sudden shocks or changes in policy. I show that standard heterogeneous-agent (HA) models—the Blanchard (1985) perpetual youth and Bewley (1986) incomplete markets models—are consistent with aggregate consumption inertia without the
use of habit preferences or any specific model of expectation underreaction to dampen the
responsiveness of consumption-savings decisions. I instead replicate observed consumption
inertia in standard HA models by directly substituting survey expectations of income and interest rates for agents’ expectations. I propose a new theory of macroeconomic inertia that rationalizes the observed extrapolation bias in survey expectations by embedding an unobserved components model of expectations into a tractable HA general equilibrium environment. Inertia results when expectations imperfectly account for the equilibrium amplification of shocks, which is large in HA economies. This imperfect inference causes expectations to gradually unanchor as agents repeatedly misattribute large responses of equilibrium outcomes simply to larger shocks. This theory also illustrates a novel drawback to inertial monetary policy rules and the delayed financing of fiscal deficits: Policy regimes that act more gradually experience longer transmission lags due to their decreased effectiveness at anchoring expectations.

  We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
  building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
  of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
  states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
  When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
  taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.

  This paper illustrates the usefulness of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods in approximating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model posterior distributions. We show how the tempering schedule can be chosen adaptively, document the accuracy and runtime benefits of generalized data tempering for ‘online’ estimation (that is, re-estimating a model as new data become available), and provide examples of multimodal posteriors that are well captured by SMC methods. We then use the online estimation of the DSGE model to compute pseudo-out-of-sample density forecasts and study the sensitivity of the predictive performance to changes in the prior distribution. We find that making priors less informative (compared with the benchmark priors used in the literature) by increasing the prior variance does not lead to a deterioration of forecast accuracy.

  The years following the Great Recession were challenging for forecasters. Unlike other deep downturns, this recession was not followed by a swift recovery, but instead generated a sizable and persistent output gap that was not accompanied by deflation as a traditional Phillips curve relationship would have predicted. Moreover, the zero lower bound and unconventional monetary policy generated an unprecedented policy environment. We document the actual real-time forecasting performance of the New York Fed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model during this period and explain the results using the pseudo real-time forecasting performance results from a battery of DSGE models. We find the New York Fed DSGE model’s forecasting accuracy to be comparable to that of private forecasters, and notably better for output growth than the median forecasts from the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections. The model’s financial frictions were key in obtaining these results, as they implied a slow recovery following the financial crisis.
