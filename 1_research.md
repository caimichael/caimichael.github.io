**Macro Inertia and the Variable Lags of Policy Transmission**  

This paper quantifies the sources of macroeconomic inertia that are within and outside
of policymakers’ influence and uncovers novel mechanisms for how policy rules can reduce
inertial policy transmission (“lags”). I introduce an approach to parameter identification in
dynamic structural models, replacing traditional assumptions on expectation formation with
expectations data. This permits the decomposition of inertia due to policy-invariant primitives,
such as preferences and technologies, from that due to policy-variant expectations. Applied to
textbook consumption-savings models, I find no empirical support for classic sources of pref-
erence inertia, such as habits. Instead, only three simple features are required to jointly match
consumption and expectations data: 1) a high current MPC ≃ 0.2, 2) a low EIS ≃ 0.1, and 3)
persistent over-extrapolation of expectations. I then study policy counterfactuals in a HANK
model with Bayesian learning, disciplined by these findings. Inertia emerges endogenously
when a measure of “belief feedback” is high, occurring precisely when the current MPC is high
and EIS is low. Otherwise, inertia is absent. Responsive monetary and fiscal policy shortens
transmission lags by reducing effective “feedback”. In turn, monetary-fiscal interactions re-
sult in a novel government debt stabilization motive: shortening the debt repayment timeline
diminishes belief feedback from inertial past expectations into future realized demand.

**Optimal Long-Run Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents**  
(with Adrien Auclert, Matt Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub)  

We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.
