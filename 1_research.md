**HANK with Actual Expectations**  

A key aspect of business cycles is the sluggish response of aggregate variables to 
macroeconomic shocks. This inertia interests researchers, as many HANK models struggle to replicate
it, and policymakers because it complicates the timing of interventions. I show that canonical 
perpetual youth and standard incomplete markets models — the core of modern HANK models —
can match this fact simply by replacing traditional assumptions on expectation formation with
expectations data. Although many existing theories of expectation formation fail to match 
patterns of forecast errors observed in expectations data, a simple model of Bayesian learning
can explain them. Building on this, I characterize the mechanisms that produce inertia in a
stylized HANK model with learning and offer a new perspective on two core dimensions of
policy choice 1) responsiveness to fluctuations, e.g. the slope of the Taylor rule, and 2) length
of time government debt is rolled over. Changing policy along these dimensions alters inertia
in shock transmission through an expectations anchoring channel, offering a novel explanation
for transmission lags and how to shorten them.  

Selected Works in Progress

**Optimal Long-Run Fiscal Policy with Heterogeneous Agents**  
(with Adrien Auclert, Matt Rognlie, and Ludwig Straub)  

We introduce a new method for characterizing the steady state of dynamic Ramsey problems,
building on the dual approach to optimal taxation. Applying this method to standard calibrations
of heterogeneous-agent models a la Aiyagari (1995), we find that in many cases Ramsey steady
states do not exist, with our results suggesting that long-run immiseration is optimal instead.
When Ramsey steady states do exist, they are associated with optimal long-run labor income
taxes close to 100%. We show that these conclusions are related to strong anticipatory effects of future tax changes.
